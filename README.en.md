#### Configuration Modifications

How to modify upload size limit?

1. In `index.php`:

   

   ```php
   const maxSize = 300 * 1024 * 1024; // 300MB
   if (file.size > maxSize) {
        displayMessage('File exceeds size limit (max 300MB).', 'warning');
        return;
   }
   ```
   Change 300 to 3000 for 3GB limit (must match other files).

2. In `file_manager.php`:

   

   ```php
   $maxFileSize = 300 * 1024 * 1024; // 300MB
   if ($filesize > $maxFileSize) {
   $responses[] = ['success' => false, 'error' => 'File exceeds size limit (max 300MB).'];
   continue;
   }
   ```
   Make identical change as step 1.

3. In phpEnv software:
   - Hover over services ‚Üí Edit PHP's `php.ini`:
     
     
     
     ```ini
     upload_max_filesize = 300M
     post_max_size = 310M       # Should exceed upload_max_filesize
     max_execution_time = 300   # Prevents timeout for large files
     max_input_time = 300       # Extended processing time
     memory_limit = 512M        # Adequate memory allocation
     ```
     Adjust values as needed.

4. Edit Nginx's `nginx.conf`:

   

   ```conf
   client_max_body_size 300M  # Nginx upload limit
   ```

5. Update notification in `index.php` (now pulls from database):

   

   ```php+HTML
   <!-- System Notice -->
   <div class="alert alert-info alert-dismissible fade show text-center announcement animate__animated animate__fadeInDown" role="alert">
        Maximum file size: 300MB. Not 1KB more! üòÅ
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animate.min.css"/>
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>
   </div>
   ```

6. Restart all services from software homepage.

Note: The documentation now reflects that the notice message is dynamically loaded from the database rather than hardcoded.
